# Train Command

**This file is for documentation only. The actual skill is in `commands/train.md`.**

Run the CLI command directly:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=~/.claude/splatworld-agent && python3 -m splatworld_agent.cli train [ARGS]
```

Do NOT implement training logic yourself. The CLI handles everything.
